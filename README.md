# malaria-deaths-internet
showcasing relationship between deaths due to malaria and internet usage by country 

The object to of my project is to find out whether there is any relationship between birth rates of various countries in this world and percentage of internet users in that country.

Conclusion:    
People from countries who belong to high income group can afford internet and the birth rate in these countries is low, may be its because of this they are wealthy enough to afford to visit family planning center and this leads to low birth rate in these countries.
